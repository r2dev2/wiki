Skin changes are common and a known (but little researched) part of ALS. The
research that has been done cites “abnormalities of collagen, glycosaminoglycans,
vascular endotherial growth factor (VEGF) and neurotrophic factors like ciliary
neurotrophic factor (CNTF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-
1)” as causes of these changes. Many PALS experience extreme dry skin and

excessive sloughing of dead skin cells that is itchy and uncomfortable.
General tips to help combat these skin problems:
- Do NOT shower or bathe in hot water. Use slightly warm water.
- Exfoliate WET SKIN ONLY. Never use any exfoliation tool on dry skin... it will either
continue the cycle or exacerbate the condition.
- In shower or bath, once skin has had ample time to soak in water, scrub thoroughly
with a bath brush, loofah, plastic bath pouf, and/or rough washcloth... in tougher areas
like feet you can use a pumice stone or exfoliating paddle.
- After shower or bath, dry thoroughly, then apply a thick lotion. Lotions that carry the
seal of the Eczema Association tend to be thicker and work best.
- Apply 2% Hydrocortisone cream on any really dry, scaly small areas.
- Consult a dermatologist if skin condition worsens or persists.
