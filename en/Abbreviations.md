ALS = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 

ELA = esclerosis lateral amiotrófica (ALS in Spanish)

MND = Motor Neuron Disease - another name for ALS; term used in the UK and other

parts of the world (see “Clarification of ALS/MND Terminology”)

PALS/pALS = person/people with ALS

CALS/cALS = caregiver(s) of a person with ALS

VALS/vALS = veteran(s) with ALS

fALS = familial ALS (NOT "familiar"), a way of saying hereditary ALS (runs in the

family)

CNS = central nervous system

UMN = Upper Motor Neurons - neurons originating from the motor cortex of the brain

and running through the spinal cord

LMN = Lower Motor Neurons - neurons that connect the spinal cord to muscle fibers,

transmitting the nerve impulses from the upper motor neurons out to the muscles

NMJ = NeuroMuscular Junction - connections between the motor nerves and skeletal

muscles

NCV = Nerve Conduction Study - test where electrodes are placed on the skin over a

nerve to stimulate the nerve and record the result; can help detect the presence of

nerve damage or destruction

EMG = ElectroMyoGraphy - a test to measure the electrical activity of a muscle; a

needle is inserted into the muscle, which acts as a microphone to amplify the sound

made by the muscle when it is contracted or relaxed; sounds (and their visual

representation on an oscilloscope) are interpreted by a neurologist to learn about the

health of muscles and nerves; specific findings on this test are required for ALS

diagnosis

LP = Lumbar Puncture, aka "spinal tap" – a needle is inserted into the space between

two lumbar vertebrae to collect CSF for diagnostic testing; CSF pressure measurements

taken during the test are also of diagnostic value

CSF = cerebrospinal fluid – surrounds the brain and spinal column; obtained during a

lumbar puncture and studied for abnormalities to diagnose various neurological

conditions

FTD = FrontoTemporal Dementia - caused by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes

of the brain; affects critical thinking, language/speech, and behavioral regions of the

brain; has been linked with some subtypes of ALS (called ALS FTD)

PBA = PseudoBulbar Affect - Uncontrollable laughing or crying due to damage to the

emotion control regions of the brain; seen in 20-50% of PALS

CNS-LS = Center for Neurologic Study – Liability Scale - a short questionnaire,

designed to be completed by the patient, that provides a quantitative measure of the

perceived frequency of PBA episodes

ALSFRS(R) = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (Revised) – an

instrument (questionnaire) for evaluating the functional status of patients with ALS and

monitoring functional change over time.

SOD1 = Superoxide dismutase 1 - an enzyme that destroys superoxide, a highly

reactive form of oxygen; the SOD1 gene is responsible for over 20% of fALS cases

Dx = diagnosis

Ventilator (aka mechanical ventilation) – a machine that breathes for a person by

moving air in and out of the lungs

NIV or NonInvasive Ventilation – use of a breathing machine/ventilator with a face

mask interface

IV or Invasive Ventilation - use of a ventilator through a tracheotomy

Trach = tracheotomy - while actually the name of the surgical procedure of making a

hole in the throat to access the trachea, most pALS call their surgical hole a "trach" or

“trache”

Stoma - actual name for the hole in the throat created during a tracheotomy

Trach Tube = tracheotomy tube - plastic tube inserted through a tracheotomy that

allows the person to breathe without using the nose or mouth, used to connect a

tracheotomy to a ventilator

FVC = Forced Vital Capacity - a measure of the total volume of air that can be exhaled

after a deep inhalation; important information for determining lung function in ALS

CPAP = Continuous Positive Airway Pressure – NIV breathing machine that provides

single pressure breathing support to keep the airway open; should NEVER be used in

ALS! In PALS, CPAP use weakens the diaphragm by requiring the patient’s body to use

extra work/force to exhale over the continuous flow of pressurized air, and can cause

CO2 retention.

BiPAP = BiLevel Positive Airway Pressure – NIV breathing machine that provides two

levels of pressure to assist breathing (inspiratory and expiratory pressures)

AVAPS = Average Volume Assured Pressure Support - a setting on certain BiPAPs and

ventilators that is beneficial and preferred in ALS

Trilogy (made by Philips Respironics) and

Astral (made by ResMed) - a versatile ventilator with many settings that can be used

with invasive and noninvasive adapters (face mask or tracheotomy)

VOCSN (made by Ventec Life Systems) – 5 machines in one: multifunction ventilator,

cough assist, suction machine, nebulizer, and oxygen generator; especially beneficial

for PALS who travel outside the home frequently

CO2 = Carbon Dioxide

O2 = Oxygen

O2 Sat or SpO2 (Oxygen Saturation) – measurement of the amount of oxygen in a

patient’s blood

Pulse Oximeter (Pulse Ox) - noninvasive infrared light device that estimates the

amount of oxygen in your blood; usually placed on finger or toe

ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) – blood test drawn from an artery (instead of a vein) to

measure the amount of O2, CO2, and other gases are in the blood (only way to test

CO2 levels)



PEG = Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - a flexible feeding tube placed through

the abdominal wall and into the stomach to allow nutrition, fluids and/or medications to

be put directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth

Mic-Key or Button = type of PEG tube that does not leave a long tube dangling outside

the body

RT = Respiratory Therapist

PT = Physical Therapist

OT = Occupational Therapist

ROM = Range of Motion - the measurement of the amount of movement around a

specific joint or body part; also refers to gentle movements/stretches to preserve range

of motion in joints

ALSA = ALS Association (USA)

ALS TDI = ALS Therapy Development Institute (Boston, USA)

NOTE: The terms “PALS” and “CALS” are plural AND singular!!!

When you try to make it singular by saying “my PAL” or “my CAL,” all you are saying is

“my Person with Amyotrophic Lateral” or “my Caregiver of Amyotrophic Lateral”.... the

“S” for “Sclerosis” is essential for the acronym to make sense. So, whether you are

talking about one person or multiple people, the acronyms are ALWAYS “PALS” and

“CALS.”
